1. Calculate the Action
file: action.py
instruction: fill in KineticAction and HarmonicPotentialAction, then run action.py, make sure the script runs without error
2. Sample Paths
file: metropolis.py
instruction: fill in metropolis_sample, then run metropolis.py, make sure plotted results agree reasonably well
3. Check Free Gas
file: free_gas.py
instruction: fill in generate_free_gas_paths, then run free_gas.py, make sure the printed kinetic energy is reasonable (considering error bar). Change nslice to see how the paths and kinetic energy change with temperature.
Now set `ready_for_next_step` to True, then rerun free_gas.py. Make sure the plotted results agree.
