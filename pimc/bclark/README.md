Start by building a simple PIMC Code for two (unpolarized) non-interacting
electrons and then make the following improvements on your code:

Subjects: 

* An external interaction term (such as may be created by a nucleus or quantum dot)
* A way to visualize the Path Integrals.
* Bisection, displace, and worm moves. Explore the implications that these changes have on the ergodicity of the system.
* Correlation between your two electrons
